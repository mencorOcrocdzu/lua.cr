In this article, we will show you how to use 3D Native CAD Converter to convert 3D models between different formats, such as IGS, STL, VDA or XML. This can be useful for data exchange between CAD programs, or for sharing your models with customers and suppliers.
 
## Step 1: Download and Install 3D Native CAD Converter
 
You can download a free trial version of 3D Native CAD Converter from the official website[^1^]. The trial version has some limitations, such as a maximum of 10 conversions per day and a watermark on the output files. To unlock the full features, you need to purchase a license key.
 
After downloading the setup file, run it and follow the instructions to install 3D Native CAD Converter on your computer. You can choose the installation folder and the language of the interface. The installation process should take only a few minutes.
 
## Step 2: Launch 3D Native CAD Converter and Select the Input File
 
Once you have installed 3D Native CAD Converter, you can launch it from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see a simple and user-friendly interface that consists of a menu bar, a toolbar and a file list.
 
To select the input file that you want to convert, you can either click on the "Open" button on the toolbar or use the "File" menu. You can also drag and drop the file from your file explorer to the file list. 3D Native CAD Converter supports more than twenty 3D file formats from STL to STEP to CATIA and Siemens NX[^1^]. You can also open 2D drawings in formats such as DXF, DWG or HPGL[^1^].
 
## Step 3: Choose the Output Format and Options
 
After selecting the input file, you need to choose the output format that you want to convert it to. You can do this by clicking on the "Convert" button on the toolbar or using the "File" menu. A dialog box will appear where you can select one of the available output formats: IGS, STL, VDA or XML.
 
You can also adjust some options for each output format, such as precision, tolerance, units or orientation. For example, if you choose STL as the output format, you can specify whether you want a binary or an ASCII file, and whether you want to invert or unify normals. You can also choose whether to create one output file per part or per assembly.
 
## Step 4: Start the Conversion Process
 
Once you have chosen the output format and options, you can start the conversion process by clicking on the "OK" button in the dialog box. You will see a progress bar that shows you how much time is left until the conversion is completed. Depending on the size and complexity of your input file, this may take from a few seconds to several minutes.
 
When the conversion is done, you will see a message that confirms that your output file has been created successfully. You can then open it with any compatible CAD program or viewer. You can also use 3D Native CAD Converter to view your output file by clicking on the "View" button on the toolbar or using the "File" menu.
 
## Conclusion
 
3D Native CAD Converter is a handy tool that enables you to convert 3D models between different formats with ease and accuracy. It supports many common and native CAD formats and offers various options for customization. It also allows you to view and analyze your models with its built-in viewer and measurement functions.
