The book is a response to Vargas Llosa's novel La tÃ­a Julia y el escribidor (Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter), published in 1977, which fictionalizes their relationship from the perspective of Vargas Llosa. Urquidi felt that the novel distorted their love story and portrayed her as a frivolous and manipulative woman. She decided to write her own version of the facts, revealing details of their intimacy, their travels, their literary projects, and their conflicts. She also criticizes Vargas Llosa's political views and his ambition for fame and power.
